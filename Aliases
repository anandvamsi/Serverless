#Aliases in the lambda function

we are aware of about the release version of the the 
- release-1
- release-2

when we release new version in the lambda, for the deployment trigger in case of cloudwatch 
  - we need to modify the the cloudwatch even traget to new version number.
  
  
 Using Aliases, it remove the above manual task  instead we Create a alias in the lambda UI and link the alias to the verion.
 - Create a alias in the lambda and link a verion to that.
 - In Cloudwatch events, instead of linking to the version , we need to select which was created in the above step::- ONLY one time
 
 Next time onwards when a new version is created, map the new version to alias in the Lambda end:- No need to change any thing in cloudwatch end
 since alias is already mapped to the newest version
